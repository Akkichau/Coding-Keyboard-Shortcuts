## 5 Useful VSCode shortcuts to improve your coding speed

- VSCode is one of the most popular editors for web development. When writing code, we often require certain formatting actions, and a lot of them are supported by VSCode itself. 
### 1. CMD + P: Opens the palette to search for a file
(Windows/Linux: CTRL + P)
- Navigating through files is one of the most common options and this command can come in pretty handy. You can type the name of the file in the search box and select the file by clicking or by pressing enter on the search result to open the file

### 2. CMD + SHIFT + L: Add cursors to all matching selections
(Windows/Linux: CTRL + SHIFT + L)
- One of my favorite features of VSCode is multi cursors. They allow you to replace text or append more text without copy-pasting or requiring you to change it one at a time.

- Using this command, you can add cursors to all matching selections in the document

### 3. CMD + D: Add cursor to next matching selection
(Windows/Linux: CTRL + D)
- Like the above command, this is also used to add cursors but with this, you can add the cursor to the next matching selection. This is especially helpful when you don't want to select all occurrences together

### 4. CMD + U: Undo last cursor operation
(Windows/Linux: CTRL + U)

- If you need to undo cursor selection in a case where you selected more cursors than required or reset the cursor to a previous position, you can use this command to undo the last cursor action

### 5. CMD + L: Select current line.
(Windows/Linux: CTRL + L)

- Often we use mouse drag to select the text, but if we want to select entire lines, we can use this command
